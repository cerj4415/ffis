	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Cerj4415, and I've been studying technology for about 3 years. I'm already a college graduate with an associate degree in computer science and, currently, studying for a bachelor degree in information techonology. The skills I've acquired, so far, are at the junior level of web development. Personally, this is somewhat disappointing, to have to wait so many years to being a career. Fortunately, this wasn't and isn't the only option for me, nor anyone else, to prepare for a career. So, I've decided to create and take a new, better path.</p>
		
		<p>Though a degree is valuable, it takes much longer than a bootcamp. Even self-guided study, which is a totally viable option for a career in technology, can be much quicker. Also, with a degree, most students will still need some additional training, before they're ready for a job. On the other hand, bootcamps give industry level training, but can be very expensive. All of these factors have made independent study the fastest and most valuable option for most. That's why I created this guide. I wanted to help myself, and others, find a free, thorough and direct path to employment.</p> 
		
		<p>I'm not experienced enough to teach the bootcamp myself, so instead, I've collected links to all of the resources I've already used or will use to further my training. My learning path has and will continue to focus on the WAMP development stack and javascript programming. Though many other topics are covered in the guide I've created, javascript and python were chosen, due to their popularity and versitility. Within 3 to 6 months, students should be competent and ready for employment in web or javascript development. Overall, the program is designed to facilitate employment in software development or information technology within a year of study, or as soon as possible. Whether you're a student, employed or unemployed, I encourage you to join me on this journey to a new career. As with most things, the more we study, the further and faster we'll progress.</p>
